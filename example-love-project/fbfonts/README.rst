FallbackFonts
=============
This library aims to make it super simple to define and use fallback fonts when printing and drawing text. It only works on an on-line basis right now, so no having two languages in a single string or it'll just come out mangled!

*FbFonts* aims to mostly replicate the standard Love library in terms of functions, to make it simple to swap in and just find-replace standard library functions with our replacements. In the future, we would like to hook the standard library functions instead if we can, to simplify things.
